Agent messaging command. **IMPORTANT: Always use the provided scripts. NEVER directly read or edit config files, DB, or team data. There is NO register.sh — use join.sh to join a team.**

**Shell requirement:** All agmsg scripts are Bash scripts. Always execute them via `bash`, never via PowerShell or cmd directly. If your default shell is not Bash (e.g. PowerShell on Windows), wrap every command with `bash -lc '...'`. Example: `bash -lc '~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/send.sh myteam alice bob "hello"'`. Do NOT construct DB paths manually — the scripts handle path resolution internally. If you need to redirect storage, use `AGMSG_STORAGE_PATH` (the supported override).

## Identity

If you already know your AGENT and TEAMS from a previous `$agmsg` call in this session, skip to **Execute** below.

Otherwise, run: `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/whoami.sh "$(pwd)" opencode`

Four possible outputs:

**A) Single identity:**
`agent=<name> teams=<t1,t2,...> type=opencode project=<path>`
→ Remember AGENT and TEAMS, then go to **Execute**.

**B) Multiple identities:**
`multiple=true agents=<n1,n2,...> teams=<t1,t2,...> type=opencode project=<path>`
→ Ask the user which agent name to use for this session, then go to **Execute**.

**C) Not in a team:**
`not_joined=true available_teams=<t1,t2,...>` (or `available_teams=none`)
→ Show the user the available teams from the output, then:

  > **First-time setup required.**
  > Joining a team so this agent can send and receive messages.
  > - **Team name**: a group of agents that can message each other (available: <list from output>)
  > - **Agent name**: this agent's identity within the team

  1. Ask: "Enter a team name (joins existing or creates new)"
  2. If the team name given already appears in `available_teams`, run `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/team.sh <team>` to see the current roster (name, type, project) and note the names already in use. Look for a naming convention already in play (e.g. a shared base name with role/number suffixes like `aggie-cc1`/`aggie-cc2`, or names derived from the team name) and, when one exists, propose 2-3 unused names that extend it; otherwise propose 2-3 short, distinctive identity names (not a bare tool-type label like `codex`/`cc`). Either way, names must not collide with the roster. Then ask: "Enter a name for this agent (suggestions: <name1>, <name2>, <name3> — or type your own)". For a brand-new team, skip the roster check and just ask: "Enter a name for this agent".
  3. **You MUST use join.sh** — run: `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/join.sh <team> <agent_name> opencode "$(pwd)"`
  4. Show the result and explain:

  > **Joined!** You can now use `$agmsg` to check and send messages.
  > - `$agmsg` — check inbox
  > - `$agmsg send <agent> <message>` — send a message
  > - `$agmsg team` — list team members
  > - `$agmsg history` — message history

  5. **REQUIRED — Do NOT skip this step.** Ask the user to pick a delivery mode using exactly this prompt:

     ```
     Choose delivery mode for incoming messages:

       1) monitor — Real-time push via the `sentinel_monitor` tool (recommended)
                     Launches watch.sh through `sentinel_monitor`; each new
                     message streams in as a notification. Falls back to
                     turn-mode self-checks if `sentinel_monitor` is unavailable.

       2) turn    — Check inbox at the end of each assistant turn
                     A rule has you self-check the inbox after each tool call.

       3) off     — No automatic delivery
                     Manual $agmsg only.

     [1]:
     ```

     - **Wait for the user's answer before proceeding.** Empty input means `1` (monitor).
     - Map the chosen number to a mode (`1`→`monitor`, `2`→`turn`, `3`→`off`) and run:
       `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/delivery.sh set <mode> opencode "$(pwd)"`
     - `both` is not supported for opencode.
     - If you chose `monitor`, follow the "Ensure monitor is running first" step below now, so the watcher starts streaming into this session immediately.

  6. Then check inbox for the newly joined team.

**D) Suggestions for reuse:**
`suggest=true agents=<n1,n2,...> teams=<t1,t2,...> type=opencode project=<path> available_teams=<t1,t2,...>`
→ No exact registration exists for this project, but there are same-type agent names registered elsewhere.

  1. Show the suggested agent names to the user.
  2. Ask whether to reuse one of those names or choose a new one.
  3. Ask for the team name to join (existing or new).
  4. Run: `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/join.sh <team> <agent_name> opencode "$(pwd)"`
  5. Then continue with the normal post-join flow above.

## Execute

**Only use scripts in `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/` — do not read or modify files under `teams/` or `db/` directly.**

**Ensure monitor is running first (monitor mode only).** If the project's delivery mode is `monitor` (check via `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/delivery.sh status opencode "$(pwd)"`) and no `agmsg inbox stream` watcher is already streaming into this session, launch one now with the `sentinel_monitor` tool:

- command: `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/watch.sh "${SENTINEL_SESSION_ID:--}" "$(pwd)" opencode`
- description: `agmsg inbox stream`

Pass the command to `sentinel_monitor` exactly as written. If `sentinel_monitor` is not available in this environment, fall back to a turn-based self-check instead: after each tool call, run `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/check-inbox.sh opencode "$(pwd)"` to check the agmsg inbox for unread messages.

Launch the watcher only once per session — if it is already streaming, do not start a second one. In `turn`/`off` mode there is no watcher; skip this.

**If no arguments provided (DEFAULT action — always do this when the command is invoked without arguments):**
1. **IMMEDIATELY** run inbox check for each TEAM: `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/inbox.sh $TEAM $AGENT`
2. Do NOT ask the user what to do — just run the inbox check.
3. If there are messages, read and respond appropriately. To reply:
   `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/send.sh $TEAM $AGENT <to_agent> "<message>"`

If argument is "history":
1. Run: `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/history.sh $TEAM $AGENT`

If argument is "team":
1. For each TEAM, run: `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/team.sh $TEAM`

If argument starts with "send" (e.g. "send misaki check the server"):
1. Parse target agent and message from the arguments
2. Determine which team the target agent belongs to, then run:
   `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/send.sh $TEAM $AGENT <to_agent> "<message>"`

If argument is "config":
1. Run: `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/config.sh show`
2. Show the output to the user.

If argument starts with "config set" (e.g. "config set hook.check_interval 30"):
1. Parse key and value from the arguments.
2. Run: `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/config.sh set <key> <value>`

If argument starts with "actas" followed by an agent name (e.g. "actas alice"):
1. Parse the new role name. If none was given (e.g. bare "actas", or the user asks you to suggest one), run `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/team.sh <team>` for each TEAM to see the current roster. Look for a naming convention already in play (e.g. a shared base name with role/number suffixes like `aggie-cc1`/`aggie-cc2`, or names derived from the team name) and, when one exists, propose 2-3 unused names that extend it; otherwise propose 2-3 short, distinctive identity names (not a bare tool-type label). Either way, names must not collide with the roster. Ask the user to pick one or type their own before continuing.
2. Run `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/identities.sh "$(pwd)" opencode` to see whether the role is already registered for this (project, type).
3. If the name does not appear in the output, join under the existing team. For a single team, run `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/join.sh <team> <name> opencode "$(pwd)"`. For multiple teams, ask the user which team to join the new role into.
4. **If delivery mode is `monitor`**, switch the watcher to the new role so receive is restricted to it. (If the sentinel tools are unavailable — plugin not installed — skip this step; the rule's turn-mode self-check still covers your roles.)
   a. Run `sentinel_list` to find a running monitor described `agmsg inbox stream`; if one is running in this session, stop it with `sentinel_stop` on its id.
   b. Launch a fresh watcher with the `sentinel_monitor` tool:
      - command: `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/watch.sh "${SENTINEL_SESSION_ID:--}" "$(pwd)" opencode <name>`
      - description: `agmsg inbox stream`
    The 4th argument restricts the subscription to messages addressed to `<name>` only. In `turn`/`off` mode there is no watcher to switch — skip this step too.
5. Set the session's active FROM to `<name>` for every `send.sh` call until another `actas`.
6. Tell the user: "Now acting as `<name>`. Sends use `<name>` as from. In monitor mode, receive is restricted to `<name>`; in turn/off mode receive still covers all your registered roles."

If argument starts with "drop" followed by an agent name (e.g. "drop alice"):
1. Parse the role name.
2. Run `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/reset.sh "$(pwd)" opencode <name>` to remove that role's registration.
3. If the session's active FROM was `<name>`, clear that state.
4. **If delivery mode is `monitor`** and the sentinel tools are available: run `sentinel_list` to find a running monitor described `agmsg inbox stream`; if one is running in this session, stop it with `sentinel_stop` on its id, then relaunch it with the `sentinel_monitor` tool using the default (no 4th arg) subscription so receive covers the project's remaining roles. If the sentinel tools are unavailable (plugin not installed), skip this step.
   - command: `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/watch.sh "${SENTINEL_SESSION_ID:--}" "$(pwd)" opencode`
   - description: `agmsg inbox stream`
5. Tell the user: "Dropped role `<name>` from this project."

If argument is "mode" (no further args):
1. Run: `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/delivery.sh status opencode "$(pwd)"`
2. Show the output to the user.

If argument starts with "mode" followed by a mode name (e.g. "mode turn"):
1. Parse the mode. OpenCode supports `monitor`, `turn`, and `off` — reject `both` with: "OpenCode does not support `both`; use `monitor`, `turn`, or `off`."
2. Run: `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/delivery.sh set <mode> opencode "$(pwd)"`
3. If the mode is `monitor`, follow the "Ensure monitor is running first" step above to launch the watcher in this session now.

If argument is "hook on" (legacy alias):
1. Run: `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/delivery.sh set turn opencode "$(pwd)"`
2. Tell the user: "Delivery mode set to 'turn' (legacy hook on behavior)."

If argument is "hook off" (legacy alias):
1. Run: `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/delivery.sh set off opencode "$(pwd)"`
2. Tell the user: "Delivery mode set to 'off'."

If argument is "version":
1. Run: `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/version.sh`
2. Show the output — the installed version (git-describe provenance recorded at install time).

If argument is "reset":
1. Run: `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/reset.sh "$(pwd)" opencode`
2. Tell the user the result.
